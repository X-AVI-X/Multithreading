# MultiThreading

In summary, this code demonstrates a simple producer-consumer interaction using threads and synchronized blocks to ensure proper synchronization when accessing the shared buffer. The producer adds items to the buffer when space is available, and the consumer removes items when they are available. The synchronized blocks and the wait() and notifyAll() methods help manage the concurrency and prevent race conditions.
